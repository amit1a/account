# Upgrading your account
{: #upgrading-account}

Lite accounts make it easy to get started with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} and try out services. When you are ready for more, you can upgrade your account to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account to unlock the entire catalog of production-ready services.
{:shortdesc}

You can check your current account type by going to **Manage > Account > Account settings** in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console and looking in the Account Type section.

Not sure which type of account you want to upgrade to? Get detailed information about the benefits of each account type in [Account types](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts).
{: tip}

To upgrade your account, you must have an access policy with the Editor role or higher on all account management services. For more information about IAM roles for managing accounts, see [Platform management roles](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles#platformroles).

## Upgrading to a Pay-As-You-Go account
{: #upgrade-paygo}

With a Pay-As-You-Go account, you pay for only what you use beyond the free runtime and service allowances. After you upgrade, you can continue to use any instances that you created with your Lite account.

To upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account, complete the following steps.
1. In the console, go to **Manage > Account**.
1. Select **Account settings**, and click **Add credit card**.
1. Enter your payment information, click **Next**, and submit your information.


After your payment information is processed, your account is upgraded and you can explore and access the full {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog. For any billable services that you use beyond any free allowances, you receive a monthly invoice. 

If you're upgrading to reactivate a deactivated account, your account might take a few days to be fully available. If your account continues to be in a pending state, see [Why can't I upgrade my account?](/docs/account?topic=account-ts_upgrade_cc) for help.

## Upgrading to a Subscription account
{: #upgrade-subscription}

With a Subscription account, you commit to a minimum spending amount each month and receive a subscription discount that is applied to that minimum charge. If your usage exceeds your total subscription amount, you're charged the regular non-discounted rate only on the overage.

Subscriptions that you purchase through the console are limited to $5,000 United States dollars (USD) or the equivalent in your billing currency. If you want to purchase a larger subscription, contact [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Sales](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?contactmodule){: external}.

To upgrade from a Lite account to a Subscription account, complete the following steps.
1. In the console, go to **Manage > Account**, and select **Account settings**. Then, click **Upgrade**, which takes you to the Subscriptions page.
1. Select your monthly spending commitment and subscription term, and click **Get started**.

   If you're not sure how much your typical usage might cost, you can estimate it by using the [cost estimator](https://{DomainName}/estimator/review){:external}.
   {:tip}
1. Review your subscription details, and then enter your payment information.

   After your payment information is processed, your subscription credit is added to your account. You can monitor your subscription usage on this same Subscriptions page. See [Managing subscriptions](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions) for more information.

Your subscription renews automatically. If you want to discontinue your subscription renewal, [contact support](https://{DomainName}/unifiedsupport/supportcenter).
